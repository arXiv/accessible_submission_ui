        <li>If the Work was created by multiple authors, that all of them have consented to the submission of the Work to arXiv.</li>
        <li>The Submitter has the right to include any third-party materials used in the Work.</li>

        <li>The Submitter has authority to make the statements, grant the rights, and take the actions described above.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Grant of the License to arXiv</h3>
        <p>The Submitter grants to arXiv upon submission of the Work a non-exclusive, perpetual, and royalty-free license to include the Work in the arXiv repository and permit users to access, view, and make other uses of the work in a manner consistent with the services and objectives of arXiv. This License includes without limitation the right for arXiv to reproduce (e.g., upload, backup, archive, preserve, and allow online access), distribute (e.g., allow access), make available, and prepare versions of the Work (e.g., , abstracts, and metadata or text files, formats to support accessibility, machine-readable formats) in analog, digital, or other formats as arXiv may deem appropriate. The rights granted will move with arXiv if arXiv moves to another steward.</p>

        <li>Any claims against arXiv or Cornell University, or any officer, employee, or agent thereof based upon any loss of content or disclosure of information provided in connection with a submission.</li>
        <li>The Submitter will indemnify, defend, and hold harmless arXiv, Cornell University and its officers, employees, agents, and other affiliated parties from any loss, damage, or claim arising out of or related to: (a) any breach of any representations or warranties herein; (b) any failure by Submitter to perform any of Submitterâ€™s obligations herein; and (c) any use of the Work as anticipated in the License and terms of submittal.</li>
        </ul>
